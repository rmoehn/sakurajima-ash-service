# sakurajima-ash-service

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Note

Naive as I am, I accidentally committed and pushed an API key. Since I'm too
lazy to purge it with a `git filter-branch`, I just reset that API key and am
now using a new one. So, if you were rubbing your hands and cackling with evil,
I shall congratulate you to having warmed your hands and now you can use them to
do good instead of abusing other people's API keys.

## Usage
